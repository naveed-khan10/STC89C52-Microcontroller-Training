# Project Review: 
## Task 1: Development Environment Setup & Microcontroller Study
- Install development tools, IDE, and drivers.
- Review the STC89C52RC microcontroller datasheet:
- Study the schematic of the development board.

## Task 2: Logic Analyzer Installation
- Download and install Logic 1.2.18 software for the logic analyzer.
- Configure the logic analyzer for debugging and signal analysis.

## Task 3: LED Blinking
- Blink LED D1 with a 500 ms delay.
- Measure the delay using a logic analyzer and attach screenshots showing the delay.

## Task 4: LED Pattern
- Alternated LEDs D1, D3, D5, D7 ON and D2, D4, D6, D8 OFF with a delay.

## Task 5: Button Interfacing Using Polling
- Controlled LED D1 using button K1 with polling.
- Added debouncing to avoid multiple triggers on a single press.
